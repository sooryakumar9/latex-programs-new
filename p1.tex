		A plain text document is a kind of document that doesn’t preserve formatting – for example links or words in bold, italics, with underline, images, colors, different font types, tables, lists with bullets/numbers. These files are normally saved as *.txt.
		
		In cases where you wish to paste text from another source into Moodle or Turnitin, it is recommended to copy from a plain text document, as formatting coming from other software has been found to create issues.
